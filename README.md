#### _A two-day game app_

#### By _**{List of contributors}**_

## Description

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
